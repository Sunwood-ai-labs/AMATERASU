<h2 align="center">Enterprise-Grade Private AI Platform (v1.17.1)</h2>

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This repository leverages [SourceSage](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/SourceSage).  Approximately 90% of the release notes, README, and commit messages are generated using [SourceSage](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/SourceSage) and [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/).

>[!NOTE]
>AMATERASU is the successor project to [MOA](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/MOA).  It has been improved to run each AI service on an independent EC2 instance using Docker Compose, and deployment is simplified with Terraform.

## 🚀 Project Overview

AMATERASU is an enterprise-grade private AI platform. Built on AWS Bedrock and Google Vertex AI, it enables the development and operation of LLM-based applications in a secure and scalable environment. Integration with GitLab streamlines version control, CI/CD pipelines, and project management.  v1.17.1 includes improvements to the `docker-compose` configuration and corrections to the port number and hostname of the `coder` service. This makes development and operation in a Docker environment smoother.


This repository is structured as a "spellbook" for managing multiple AI-related projects. Each project is organized as a separate folder for deploying and managing specific AI services or features.
