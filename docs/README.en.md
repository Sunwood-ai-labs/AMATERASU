<h2 align="center">Enterprise-Grade Private AI Platform (üöÄ AMATERASU v1.22.0)</h2>

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This repository leverages [SourceSage](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/SourceSage).  Approximately 90% of the release notes, README, and commit messages were generated using [SourceSage](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/SourceSage) and [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/).

>[!NOTE]
>AMATERASU is the successor project to [MOA](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/MOA).  It has evolved to run each AI service as an independent EC2 instance using Docker Compose, enabling easy deployment with Terraform.

## üöÄ Project Overview

AMATERASU is an enterprise-grade private AI platform. Built on AWS Bedrock and Google Vertex AI, it allows for the development and operation of LLM-based applications in a secure and scalable environment.  Integration with GitLab streamlines version control, CI/CD pipelines, and project management. This repository is structured as a "Spellbook" for managing multiple AI-related projects. Each project is organized as a separate folder for deploying and managing specific AI services or functionalities.


## ‚ú® Key Features

### Secure Foundation
- Secure LLM foundation based on AWS Bedrock and Google Vertex AI
- Operation in a completely closed environment
- Enterprise-grade security

### Microservice Architecture
- Independent service components
- Container-based deployment
- Flexible scaling

### Infrastructure as Code
- Fully automated deployment with Terraform
- Environment-specific configuration management
- Version-controlled configuration

### GitLab Integration
- Enhanced version control, CI/CD pipelines, and project management features
- Integration with self-hosted GitLab instances
- LLM-powered merge request analysis
- Automated labeling using GitLab webhooks

### Project Exploration Feature
- Automatic detection of Terraform projects and generation of `terraform.tfvars` files
- Simplified configuration using the `amaterasu` command-line tool

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

![](docs/flow.svg)

- AMATERASU Base Infrastructure provides reusable infrastructure components, reducing costs and management overhead.
- Multi-layered security is achieved with security groups for different purposes (Default, CloudFront, VPC Internal, Whitelist).
- The AMATERASU EC2 Module runs Docker containers on EC2 instances.
- The AMATERASU EE Module uses an ECS cluster, deploying from a development environment to ECR for operation.
- Both modules are protected by an IP whitelist using CloudFront and WAF and share the same base infrastructure.
- The entire infrastructure is managed by a modular design using Terraform, leveraging the same security groups and network settings.
