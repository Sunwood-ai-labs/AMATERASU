<h2 align="center">Enterprise-Grade Private AI Platform (v1.21.0)</h2>

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This repository leverages [SourceSage](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/SourceSage).  Approximately 90% of the release notes, README, and commit messages were generated using [SourceSage](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/SourceSage) and [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/).

>[!NOTE]
>AMATERASU is the successor project to [MOA](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/MOA).  It has evolved to run each AI service as an independent EC2 instance using Docker Compose, enabling easy deployment with Terraform.

## üöÄ Project Overview

AMATERASU is an enterprise-grade private AI platform. Built on AWS Bedrock and Google Vertex AI, it allows for the development and operation of LLM-powered applications in a secure and scalable environment.  Integration with GitLab streamlines version control, CI/CD pipelines, and project management. This repository is structured as a "spellbook" for managing multiple AI-related projects. Each project is organized as a separate folder for deploying and managing specific AI services or functionalities.

- **Expanded LLM Tester Functionality**: Added two types of interfaces based on Gradio and Streamlit.  IP address information and detailed debug information can now be displayed.
- **Enhanced LiteLLM Functionality**: Integrated OpenRouter API and standardized model names.
- **Infrastructure Improvements**: Optimized Docker environment, strengthened inter-container communication, and updated the NextAuth URL setting for Langfuse3.
- **Added New Presentation Tool**: Added Marp Editable UI. Provides a containerized Markdown presentation editing environment.
- **Enhanced Security**: Improved WAF settings, CSV file management for IP whitelists, and flexible security rule settings.
- **Improved Configuration Management**: Added `.env.example` files for each component to standardize and document configuration files.

- üìù Notes:
    - Existing configuration files need to be updated due to changes in LiteLLM settings.
    - The WAF IP whitelist needs to be migrated to the new CSV format.
    - Check the environment variable settings and update as needed.
