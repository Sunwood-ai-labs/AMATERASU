<h2 align="center">Enterprise-Grade Private AI Platform (v1.6.1)</h2>

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This repository leverages [SourceSage](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/SourceSage).  Approximately 90% of the release notes, README, and commit messages were generated using [SourceSage](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/SourceSage) and [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/).

>[!NOTE]
>AMATERASU is the successor project to [MOA](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/MOA).  It has been enhanced to run each AI service as an independent EC2 instance using Docker Compose, enabling easier deployment with Terraform.

## üîß Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites
- AWS Account
- Terraform >= 0.12
- Docker & Docker Compose
- AWS CLI configured

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/AMATERASU.git
cd AMATERASU
```

2. Set environment variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

3. Deploy infrastructure (You need to deploy the infrastructure for each service in the `spellbook` directory individually.)
```bash
cd spellbook/base-infrastructure
terraform init && terraform apply

cd ../open-webui/terraform/main-infrastructure
terraform init && terraform apply

cd ../../litellm/terraform/main-infrastructure
terraform init && terraform apply

cd ../../langfuse/terraform/main-infrastructure
terraform init && terraform apply

cd ../../gitlab/terraform/main-infrastructure
terraform init && terraform apply

cd ../../FG-prompt-pandora/terraform
terraform init && terraform apply
```

4. Start services (You need to start each service in the `spellbook` directory individually.)

```bash
# Langfuse
cd ../../../langfuse
docker-compose up -d

# LiteLLM
cd ../litellm
docker-compose up -d

# Open WebUI
cd ../open-webui
docker-compose up -d

# GitLab
cd ../gitlab
docker-compose up -d

# FG-prompt-pandora
cd ../FG-prompt-pandora
docker-compose up -d
```

### GitLab Setup

1. Create the environment configuration file:
```bash
cd spellbook/gitlab
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Set environment variables: Edit the `.env` file and set the necessary environment variables, such as `GITLAB_HOME`, `GITLAB_HOSTNAME`, `GITLAB_ROOT_PASSWORD`.

3. Start GitLab:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Configure backups (optional): Create a backup directory and run the `docker-compose exec gitlab gitlab-backup create` command to perform a backup.
