<h2 align="center">Enterprise-Grade Private AI Platform (v1.14.0)</h2>

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This repository leverages [SourceSage](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/SourceSage), and approximately 90% of the release notes, README, and commit messages were generated using [SourceSage](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/SourceSage) + [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/).

>[!NOTE]
>AMATERASU is the successor project to [MOA](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/MOA).  It has evolved to run each AI service in an independent EC2 instance using Docker Compose, enabling easy deployment with Terraform.

## üöÄ Project Overview

AMATERASU is an enterprise-grade private AI platform. Built on AWS Bedrock and Google Vertex AI, it allows you to develop and operate LLM-based applications in a secure and scalable environment.  Integration with GitLab streamlines version control, CI/CD pipelines, and project management.  v1.14.0 includes Terraform code to simplify the construction and management of AWS infrastructure, and a module for easier CloudFront infrastructure setup.  Setup scripts and output value definitions have been added to improve Dify setup and operation.

This repository is structured as a "spellbook" for managing multiple AI-related projects. Each project is organized as a separate folder for deploying and managing specific AI services or functionalities.
