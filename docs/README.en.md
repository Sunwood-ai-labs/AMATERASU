<h2 align="center">Enterprise-Grade Private AI Platform (v1.15.1)</h2>

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This repository leverages [SourceSage](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/SourceSage).  Approximately 90% of the release notes, README, and commit messages are generated using [SourceSage](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/SourceSage) and [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/).

>[!NOTE]
>AMATERASU is the successor project to [MOA](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/MOA). It has evolved to run each AI service on an independent EC2 instance using Docker Compose, enabling easy deployment with Terraform.

## üöÄ Project Overview

AMATERASU is an enterprise-grade private AI platform. Built on AWS Bedrock and Google Vertex AI, it allows you to develop and operate LLM-based applications in a secure and scalable environment. Integration with GitLab streamlines version control, CI/CD pipelines, and project management.  v1.15.1 includes additions to the `fg-prompt-pandora` project such as an IP whitelist function using AWS WAFv2, enhanced CloudFront settings, and improved ALB target group configurations.  Documentation updates have also been made.

This repository is structured as a "spellbook" for managing multiple AI-related projects. Each project is organized as a separate folder for deploying and managing specific AI services or features.
