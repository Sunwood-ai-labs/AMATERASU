<h2 align="center">Enterprise-Grade Private AI Platform (v1.12.0)</h2>

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This repository leverages [SourceSage](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/SourceSage).  Approximately 90% of the release notes, README, and commit messages were generated using [SourceSage](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/SourceSage) and [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/).

>[!NOTE]
>AMATERASU is the successor project to [MOA](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/MOA).  It has evolved to run each AI service as an independent EC2 instance using Docker Compose, allowing for easy deployment with Terraform.

## 🚀 Project Overview

AMATERASU is an enterprise-grade private AI platform. Built on AWS Bedrock and Google Vertex AI, it allows for the development and operation of LLM-based applications in a secure and scalable environment. Integration with GitLab streamlines version control, CI/CD pipelines, and project management.  v1.12.0 includes a new Terraform variable generator web application.

## ✨ Key Features

### Secure Foundation
- Secure LLM foundation based on AWS Bedrock and Google Vertex AI
- Operation in a completely closed environment
- Enterprise-grade security

### Microservice Architecture
- Independent service components
- Container-based deployment
- Flexible scaling

### Infrastructure as Code
- Fully automated deployment with Terraform
- Environment-specific configuration management
- Version-controlled configuration

### GitLab Integration
- Enhanced version control, CI/CD pipelines, and project management
- Integration with self-hosted GitLab instances
- LLM-powered merge request analysis
- Automated labeling using GitLab webhooks
